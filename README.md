<u><b>**Mandelbrot Fractal Paralellism CPU**<u><b>

This project demonstrates generating the Mandelbrot fractal using CPU parallelization in C++. The parallelization is achieved by distributing the computation across multiple CPU threads. Created for learning purposes.

<u><b>**Features**<u><b>

- **Parallel Processing:** Uses multiple CPU threads for faster computation.
- **Custom Resolution:** The resolution of the generated image can be customized. Default resolution: 6400x4800 pixels.
- **Custom Iteration Limit:** The maximum number of iterations for calculating the Mandelbrot set can be customized. Default: 1000 iterations.
- **Custom Thread Count:** The number of CPU threads used for parallel processing can be customized. Default: Maximum available threads.
- **BMP Output:** The generated fractal image is saved in BMP format as mandelbrot.bmp in the same directory as the executable.

<u><b>**Requirements**<u><b>

- **C++11** or later
- **Standard** Library
